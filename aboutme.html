  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Melvin V</strong> — a <strong>3D & Full-Stack Developer</strong> driven by curiosity, creativity, and a passion for merging art with technology.
    With a <strong>Master’s degree in Computer Science (M.Sc.)</strong>, I’ve developed a strong foundation in software development, interactive media, and artificial intelligence.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey in tech started with designing small web applications and exploring how visual elements can come alive through code. 
    Over time, I grew fascinated by the blend of <strong>3D graphics</strong>, <strong>animation</strong>, and <strong>interactive web experiences</strong>. 
    Today, I specialize in crafting immersive digital spaces using <strong>Three.js</strong>, <strong>Blender</strong>, and modern web technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the development side, I’m skilled in building end-to-end solutions — from designing intuitive front-end interfaces with 
    <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, to developing scalable back-end systems using <strong>Python (Flask)</strong> and <strong>Java (Spring Boot)</strong>.
    I love working on projects that challenge both my creative and technical thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests go beyond traditional software — I’ve explored projects in <strong>voice-based authentication systems</strong>, 
    <strong>deepfake detection</strong>, and <strong>AI-generated content analysis</strong>, reflecting my enthusiasm for emerging fields in deep learning and digital forensics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every project I build tells a story. Whether it’s a 3D interactive landing page, a responsive portfolio, or a machine learning application, 
    I aim to create something meaningful — experiences that connect technology and human emotion.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe in continuous learning and love experimenting with new frameworks, animation techniques, and visual storytelling tools. 
    My ultimate goal is to evolve as a developer who can bridge creativity and logic — transforming abstract ideas into immersive digital realities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring visual design, experimenting with sound, and learning about advancements in artificial intelligence. 
    I’m always open to collaborations that push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web.
